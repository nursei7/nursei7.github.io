                    Zunair, Nurgazy, Usman and Sony are students at NYU Abu Dhabi. Back in pre-Covid-19 times they were 
                    “gym buddies”. It was always Sony who gathered all of them for a workout and was 
                    guiding his friends showing right techniques and making a training plan. 
                </p>      
                <p class = "about-text">
                    Unfortunately, 
                    quarantine and long distance between them has put their friendship and a healthy habit of 
                    exercising together in a hard condition. Each and every one of them are occupied by 
                    their hobbies to cope with isolation albeit they miss their friends and the joy of 
                    physical activities.
                </p>
                <p class = "about-text">
                    Finally, Sony cannot bear the lonely workouts and longing 
                    for seeing his friends. He calls them to invite to a virtual workout where they reunite 
                    doing push ups during which everybody catches themselves thinking how important it is to 
                    maintain connection with friends and constantly exercise.
