This is a website for a film that we shoot for Communications lab class.

The role of the website is to tell the story of the film "Together we thrive" which conveys the idea of connecting with your friends during hard pandemic times and exercise to beat stress and lonelyness. 

The website entirely build on HTML and CSS. Initaially I was planning to use JavaScript to add some interaction however that idea was easily solved by HTML.

* The structure of the website

Everything on the website is implemented on one page that consists of five sections:
1. Home page, where the film is projected from YouTube link
2. About section that tells the story behind the film.
3. Team. This part of the page has four boxes with pictures of actors, their names and a button that refers to their corresponding facebook accounts for users to contact them.
4. Home workout materials. It has videos from Youtube that illustrated different exercises in home conditions. The aim of it is to educate website visitors to proper techniques.
5.Contacts. This sector of the website is to encourage the visitors to connects us after they get motiveted. The "join us" button refers to my Zoom meeting room.


* HTML used in the website
1. Div tags were used a lot to give the website a desireable structure and manipulate components easier.
2. External links and href to direct users to different sources.
3. Buttons - to make it more interactive.
4. Tag classes and id's. ID's came in very handy while implementing immediate scroll down when users clicks on a text in navigation bar. 

* CSS used in the website
1. Very basic yet crucial role of CSS was to position object in correct order
2. Ability to use different colors, fonts, giving different forms to objects, rounded corners and casting object shadows.
3. Usage of object and screen ratios in making the website more adaptive
