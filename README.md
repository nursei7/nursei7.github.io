This is a website for a film that we shoot for Communications lab class.

The role of the website is to tell the story of the film "Together we thrive" which conveys the idea of connecting with your friends during hard pandemic times and exercise to beat stress and lonelyness. 

The website entirely build on HTML and CSS. Initaially I was planning to use JavaScript to add some interaction however that idea was easily solved by HTML.

* The structure of the website

Everything on the website is implemented on one page that consists of five sections:
1. Home page, where the film is projected from YouTube link
2. About section that tells the story behind the film.
3. Team. This part of the page has four boxes with pictures of actors, their names and a button that refers to their corresponding facebook accounts for users to contact them.
4. Home workout materials. It has videos from Youtube that illustrated different exercises in home conditions. The aim of it is to educate website visitors to proper techniques.
5.Contacts. This sector of the website is to encourage the visitors to connects us after they get motiveted. The "join us" button refers to my Zoom meeting room.


* HTML used in the website
1. Div tags were used a lot to give the website a desireable structure and manipulate components easier.
2. External links and href to direct users to different sources.
3. Buttons - to make it more interactive.
4. Tag classes and id's. ID's came in very handy while implementing immediate scroll down when users clicks on a text in navigation bar. 

* CSS used in the website
1. Very basic yet crucial role of CSS was to position object in correct order
2. Ability to use different colors, fonts, giving different forms to objects, rounded corners and casting object shadows.
3. Usage of object and screen ratios in making the website more adaptive


Assignment #2 documentation

The title of our interactive comic is “Pride (And How To React To Your Child Coming Out)”.

The plot tells the story of a young man who happily embraces his identity as a homosexual man; however, he still does not know how to tell his parents. After finding a poster for an LGBTQ+ party in his bedroom, the parents confront their son and demand to know the truth. The user is given the choice to be either the boy or the parents, and his/her choices will affect how the plot will play out. In addition, there are some hidden sound effects that can be played throughout the comic when clicked on. 

We aimed to create an educational and immersive experience for the user, which allows them to dive into the perspectives of both the parent and the child. Through not giving the main characters names, it creates a more general experience for the user and allows them to be put in the shoes of the protagonists.  In addition, we wanted to portray how one’s sexual orientation is a big part of their identity. Through only adding color to the rainbow-colored bands and pink glow of those accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, this creates emphasis on the main message of the story. We used Adobe Illustrator to turn the drawings into SVG’s, and often used Adobe Photoshop to tweak the color correction of the photos to make them pop more.

We initially found it difficult to work as a team, considering the time constraint and the inability to meet up in person and talk about our assigned tasks. However, as time went on, we were able to better cooperate with one another and produce our final result. With Katie working on the drawings and finding the sound effects, Youssef on the storyline and responsiveness of the website, Nurgazy on the general structure of the website, and Yusra with the interactivity and the flow of the website, we were able to work together and meet our goals for the site.
